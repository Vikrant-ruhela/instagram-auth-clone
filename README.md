# Instagram Clone Backend

Welcome to the Instagram Clone Backend repository! This project focuses on implementing backend functionality for an Instagram-like application. It includes features for user signup and login, using technologies like bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication.

## Features

The backend project consists of the following features:

### Signup

- In the Signup feature, user data is validated, and the password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storing it in the database. Upon successful signup, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client, which is stored in a cookie for subsequent authentication.

### Login

- The Login feature involves comparing the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database. If the user is valid, they are authenticated and granted access to the application.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install all the required dependencies for the backend by running the following command inside the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

3. To run the frontend part of the Instagram Clone, you can use a live server extension that supports HTML files. Ensure that you have a live server extension installed in your preferred code editor and open the frontend files using it.

4. To start the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
nodemon
```

The backend server will be up and running, allowing you to test the signup and login functionality using the frontend part.
